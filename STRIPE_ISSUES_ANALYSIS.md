# Stripe Integration Issues Analysis & Fixes

## 🔍 **Issues Identified**

### 1. **Missing Frontend Stripe Package**
- Frontend lacks `@stripe/stripe-js` for proper Stripe integration
- No Stripe Elements or direct payment handling

### 2. **Authentication Problems**
- Frontend API calls missing authentication headers
- Backend payment routes require authentication but frontend doesn't send tokens

### 3. **Environment Variable Issues**
- Frontend `.env` has Stripe public key but it's not being used
- Backend connection URLs may be misconfigured

### 4. **Database Connection**
- Using transaction pooler instead of session pooler for Stripe operations

## 🔧 **Fixes Required**

### Fix 1: Install Frontend Stripe Package
```bash
cd /Users/danielelkjaer/Desktop/AI-rookie\ 2/Untitled
npm install @stripe/stripe-js
```

### Fix 2: Update Frontend API Hook with Authentication
The `useApi` hook needs to include authentication headers.

### Fix 3: Proper Stripe Elements Integration
Add proper Stripe payment form instead of just redirecting to Checkout.

### Fix 4: Fix Environment Variables
Ensure all Stripe keys are properly configured.

### Fix 5: Update Database Connection for Payments
Backend should use session pooler for payment operations.

## 🚨 **Critical Issues**

1. **Authentication Flow**: Backend expects authenticated requests but frontend doesn't send auth tokens
2. **Payment Flow**: Missing proper Stripe.js integration on frontend
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error reporting makes debugging difficult

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. Install missing packages
2. Fix authentication in API calls
3. Implement proper Stripe Elements
4. Test payment flow end-to-end
5. Add comprehensive error handling

## 🔗 **Current Flow Issues**

**Current Flow**: Frontend → Backend API (unauthenticated) → Stripe Checkout URL → Redirect
**Expected Flow**: Frontend → Backend API (authenticated) → Stripe Session → Payment Success

The main issue is that the frontend is making unauthenticated API calls to backend routes that require authentication.
