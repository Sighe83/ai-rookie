# Tutor Dashboard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Available Slots Calculation
**Problem**: Dashboard was using hardcoded estimates (40 slots/week) instead of actual availability data

**Fix**: Updated `useTutorStats` hook to:
- Query the new `tutor_time_slots` table for actual available slots
- Count only slots where `is_available = true` AND `is_booked = false`
- Added fallback to old estimation method if new table doesn't exist
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 2. ✅ Booking Count Accuracy  
**Problem**: Next 7 days bookings might not include all relevant statuses

**Fix**: 
- Updated query to include both `CONFIRMED` and `PENDING` bookings
- Added more detailed logging to debug count issues
- Improved date range calculations

### 3. ✅ Monthly Earnings Calculation
**Problem**: Potential double conversion from øre to kroner

**Fix**:
- Removed unnecessary division by 100 (prices are already stored in kroner)
- Added debug logging to verify calculations

### 4. ✅ Completed Sessions Count
**Problem**: Basic counting was correct, but added better error handling

**Fix**:
- Added debug logging to verify count accuracy
- Improved error handling for database queries

## Updated Statistics Display

The dashboard now shows:

1. **Kommende 7 dage** - Accurate count of confirmed + pending bookings
2. **Næste uge** - Real available slots from `tutor_time_slots` table (with fallback)
3. **Denne måned** - Correct monthly earnings in kroner
4. **Total** - Accurate count of completed sessions

## Database Migration Impact

### Before Migration:
- Available slots: Hardcoded estimate (40/week)
- No real-time availability tracking

### After Migration:
- Available slots: Real data from `tutor_time_slots` table
- Accurate availability based on actual time slot availability
- Better integration with booking system

## Error Handling Improvements

- Added fallback mechanisms if new table doesn't exist
- Better error logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation to old calculation methods
- Console logging for troubleshooting statistics

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for "Tutor Stats Debug" messages to verify data
2. **Verify Available Slots**: 
   - Should show actual available slots if `tutor_time_slots` table exists
   - Should show estimated slots (40 - booked) as fallback
3. **Check Booking Counts**: Verify numbers match actual bookings in database
4. **Test Different Time Periods**: Verify calculations work for different months/weeks

## Files Modified:
- `src/hooks/useApi.js` - Updated `useTutorStats` function
- Dashboard automatically benefits from these fixes

## Console Debug Information:
The system now logs detailed statistics to help identify data issues:
```javascript
{
  tutorId: "uuid",
  next7DaysCount: 5,
  availableSlots: 12,
  monthlyEarnings: 2500,
  completedCount: 8,
  nextWeekStart: "2025-08-12",
  nextWeekEnd: "2025-08-18"
}
```
